# web-loops

A web loop (or web ring) is a group of websites connected together in a circular structure which was popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. These groups formed around common interests or topics, so that early users of the internet could more easily find related websites before the era of powerful search engines.

The concept of a search engine is great but the present reality can be underwhelming. Google is great for finding large, search-engine-optimized websites. But sometimes, I want to find smaller websites made by individuals who are passionate about the content they are creating but don't have the means to reach the first page of Google.

The information on some of these smaller websites is often more informative and less cluttered with links, ads, and irrelevant attention grabs. By forming into loops or rings, a user only has to stumble across one of these smaller websites to gain easy access to all of them. Web loops can make this hidden, but high-quality information, easier for people to access and learn from.

Below you can see a small test loop I created with just this website and my own personal website in it.
