            <p>A web loop (or web ring) is a group of websites connected
            together in a circular structure which was popular in the 1990s and
            early 2000s. These groups formed around common interests or topics,
            so that early users of the internet could more easily find related
            websites before the era of powerful search engines.</p>
            <p>The concept of a search engine is great but the present reality
            can be underwhelming. Google is great for finding large, search
            engine optimized websites. But sometimes, I want to find smaller
            websites made by individuals who are passionate about the content
            they are creating but don't have the means to reach the first page
            of Google.</p>
            <p>The information on some of these smaller websites is often more
            informative and less cluttered with links, ads, and irrelevant
            attention grabs. By forming into loops or rings, a user only has to
            stumble across one of these smaller websites to gain easy access to
            all of them. Web loops can make this hidden, but high-quality
            information easier for people to access and learn from.</p>
            <p>At the top of this page, you can see a small test loop I created
            with just this website and my own personal website in it.</p>
