            <h2>What is Tufts Loop?</h1>
            <p>Tufts Loop is a web loop for sites created by Tufts students.
            You can browse the sites currently in the loop using the `Prev` and
            `Next` links at the top right of this page. You should see a
            similar component on every website you visit. If you want to come
            back here, click on the `Tufts Loop` link.</p>
            <p>A web loop (or web ring) is a group of websites connected
            together in a circular structure which was popular in the 1990s and
            early 2000s. These groups formed around common interests or topics,
            so that early users of the internet could more easily find related
            websites before the era of powerful search engines.</p>
            <p>The concept of a search engine is great but the present reality
            can be underwhelming. Google is great for finding large, search
            engine optimized websites. But sometimes, you want to find smaller
            websites made by people who don't have the means to reach the
            first page of Google.</p>
            <p>The information on some of these smaller websites is often more
            informative and less cluttered with links, ads, and irrelevant
            attention grabs. By forming into loops or rings, a user only has to
            stumble across one of these smaller websites to gain easy access to
            all of them. Web loops can make this hidden, but high-quality
            information easier for people to access and learn from.</p>
            <h2>How do I join Tufts Loop?</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Add
                    <a href="">this</a>
                    javascript file and the following navigation element to
                    your website:</p>
                    <pre><code>
&lt;nav id="tufts-loop" name="tufts-loop"&gt;
    &lt;a id="main"&gt;Tufts Loop&lt;/a&gt;:
    &lt;a id="prev"&gt;Prev&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;a id="next"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/nav&gt;
                    </pre></code>
                    <p>Feel free to tweak the component to fit into your site's
                    design. As long as the 'id' and 'name' fields are
                    configured properly, everything should still function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make a pull request
                    <a href="https://github.com/c2000e/web-loops">here</a>,
                    adding your information to the `tufts-loop.json` file. Your
                    site's name in the json file must match the 'name'
                    parameter of the &lt;nav&gt; component.</p>
